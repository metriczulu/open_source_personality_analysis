# Open Source Psychometric Personality Data
> Small project to explore and analyze data from a large number of personality tests

The personality dataset contains individual answers to a 163 question personality test along with demographic and test data from about 49,000 people.  Throughout various notebooks, the data is explored, cleaned, transformed and various models are built to predict demographic data from test answers.  The data can be downloaded directly from Open Source Psychometric [here.](http://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/16PF.zip)
This repository will be updated as new notebooks are created.  The first commit consists of the data itself and an EDA of the data.
