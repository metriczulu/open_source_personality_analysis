# Open Source Psychometric Personality Data
> Small project to explore and analyze data from a large number of personality tests

The personality dataset contains individual answers to a 163 question personality test along with demographic and test data from about 49,000 people.  Throughout various notebooks, the data is explored, cleaned, transformed and various models are built to predict demographic data from test answers.  The data can be downloaded directly from Open Source Psychometric [here.](http://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/16PF.zip)  A complete description of all variables and questions compiled by Open Source Psychometrics can be seen [here.](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/metriczulu/open_source_personality_analysis/blob/master/data/personality_variables.html)

This repository will be updated as new notebooks are created.
